# OMI
Implementation of the `OMI_audio_emitter` glTF extension in C++.  
  
For Windows, this project depends on Eclipse C++, MSYS2 and the listed libraries.
At a later point of time, this will be resolved by adding a CMake file plus making the required changes to build for different platforms.  
  
This project is a research project to evaluate a possible integration of this extension into [Gestaltor](https://gestaltor.io/).  
  
## Required libraries for MSYS2
`pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-mpg123`  
`pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-nlohmann-json`  
`pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-openal`
